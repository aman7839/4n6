        <h2>Who created 4N6 Speech Drama.com?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Laurie L. Mooney . . . . </li>
            <li>A high school Speech and drama coach with 12+ years of experience.   
            </li>
            <li>A college forensic competitor for Wichita State University.
            </li>
            <li>A high school state champion in both Dramatic and Duo Interp</li>
            <li>A state qualified judge for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>A NSDA member coach - First Diamond</li>
            <li>A dynamic workshop presenter available for state conferences and workshops on speaking/acting/
                interp events and hands-on experience with 4N6 Fanatics.</li>
            <li>We've already traveled to state conferences in Virginia, Nebraska and Missouri -- is your state next??</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h2>Why was 4N6 Speech Drama.com created? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To organize existing class performance materials.</li>
            <li>To transform an archaic paper-based filing system which was teacher dependent into a digital 
                database easy enough for independent student use.</li>
            <li>To allow students to access performance material 24/7 online.</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h2>Why a membership-based subscription service? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A web-based system of up-to-date award winning selections is an invaluable resource for building 
                or expanding the abilities and success of a speech team or drama class.</li>
            <li>No other websites document the award history (including state awards) of performance material.</li>
            <li>Programs are yearning for re-vitalization, but with ever-changing standards and increased demands 
                on teachers/coaches, little time is left to research new material.</li>
            <li><span>NOTE: </span> Each membership is for one (1) school only.  Member schools should not share their log-ins 
                with other schools within or outside of their district.  Sharing log-in information ultimately results 
                in the inability of 4N6 Fanatics to continue functioning as a business.</li>
       
        </ul>
        <h2>How long has 4N6 Speech Drama been in business? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The 2022 - 2023 academic year marks the 19th year anniversary of continuous on-line service to 
                the educational community! 
                </li>
    
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Is 4N6 Speech Drama recognized as an on-line publisher by the 
National Speech and Debate Association?
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4N6 Speech Drama is NOT a publishing company; and as such is not recognized by the NSDA as an on-line 
                script publisher. Coaches must obtain the original source as described in our <span>USER'S GUIDE</span>.
                4N6 Speech Drama provides complete source citations to aid in the retention of the original source. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Do 4N6 Speech Drama Cuttings stored in the VAULT meet the 
            requirements for competition in my state? </h2>
            <ul><li>Rules for each event category vary from state to state and also over time. Coaches/students should 
                ALWAYS check the CURRENT event rules to ensure that selections chosen meet CURRENT event 
                guidelines for your tournaments. (See our <span>USER'S GUIDE</span> for specific examples)</li></ul>
